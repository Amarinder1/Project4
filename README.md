This program is a coffee shop locater made using JavaScript, JQuery, and Google Maps API

To run this program, fork and clone it down. You do not need to install anything. Please get your API key from Google.

The function of this program is to find the 9 closest coffee shops within 1 mile from your center location. If you want directions to the coffee shop, click the marker and Google Maps will open in a new tab.
I have the starting center location set at the White House. To set a new center location, double click anywhere in the United States.
